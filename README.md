# BANK MARKETING

## ABSTRACT / SUMMARY OF PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls.

Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
POTENTIAL USE-CASES / APPLICATIONS OF THE PROJECT:

From the analysis of the project, we can have some business suggestions for the Bank Institution.

Thus, this will help the Institution to take into account several dependent factors for Direct Marketing Campaigns and thereby increase the no. of clients subscribing to their bank term deposit.

## INSIGHTS ABOUT THE CURRENT PROBLEM:

Firstly, we wanted to investigate why many no. of clients have denied for subscription of the product and further how the scope can be increased.

So, an EDA was done for the same. To predict the customer response to bank direct marketing, various classifiers were used, this was the first objective. Second objective was to identify the key features of customers who subscribed and are most likely to subsequently subscribe to term deposits.

As mentioned earlier, we have came up with several Suggestions for the Bank Institution:

    Focus on the customers who have had business before with the bank, they are more likely to stay.
    Customers who attended the campaign for 1-3 times and spent more time on the phone during campaign are likely to subscribe.
    Customers who have stable cash balance are more likely to deposit money in the bank.
    3-5 days after the campaign is the best time to follow up the customers.
    Customers with a minimum of Secondary School Education are good prospects to be targeted for the bank term deposit subscriptions.
    Customers having no default must be targeted.
    Contact month should be April-August.
    Age should be 30-40 preferrably Married.
    Contact type should be Cellular.
    Both Housing as well as Personal Loans can be offered by the bank.
